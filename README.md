## Introduction

Command Line Word Guess is a command-line application that allows the user to play a game to guess a mystery word by typing letters from the keyboard.

The app uses `inquirer` to prompt the user with queries rendered with `chalk`, and the returned data is used to determine whether the user has won or lost the game.

I made this app to learn about Object-oriented programming concepts including Classes, Test-Driven Development and separation of concerns using classes.
